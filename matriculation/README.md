# Matriculation

This folder contains all technical assets related to the **Matriculation**.  
It includes credential schemas, signed examples, field definitions, mappings, and localization resources used for credential generation and validation.

A matriculation credential confirms formal admission and enrollment of a student
into an educational institution, marking their official entry into a degree
program or course of study. Historically significant in European higher
education systems, it establishes the student's membership in the academic
community and their right to pursue the specified qualification. This credential
is distinct from confirmation of enrollment as it represents the initial
acceptance and registration rather than ongoing status.
