# Microcredential

This folder contains all technical assets related to the **Microcredential** feature.  
It includes credential schemas, signed examples, field definitions, mappings, and localization resources used for credential generation and validation.

A microcredential certifies achievement of specific, defined learning outcomes, skills, or competencies through a focused learning experience. Typically requiring 10-200 hours of effort, these credentials are designed to be stackable, portable, and digitally verifiable. Unlike participation-based certificates, microcredentials are competency-based and require demonstrated achievement through assessment. They provide flexible pathways for professional development, reskilling, and specialised expertise, responding quickly to emerging skill demands while being recognised within established quality assurance frameworks such as the European Qualifications Framework.
